# Extraction

This capsule combines cellpose and suite2p to perform cell detection and signal extraction.

## Input

All parameters are passed to extraction.py using `python extraction.py [parameters]`.
All parameters are defined in __main__ using argparse. The most important one is
'input-dir' which should point to a directory that includes an hdf5 file with a 'data' 3D array 
of the _registered_ (or, in the case of multi-plane imaging, _decrosstalked_) movie. 

## Output

The main output is the `extraction.h5` file.
<br>
It contains three groups: `traces`, `rois`, and `cellpose`.

__`traces`:__
- `corrected`: Neuropil-corrected fluorescence traces
- `roi`: Neuropil-corrupted raw fluorescence traces of each ROI
- `neuropil`: Neuropil fluorescence traces
- `skew`: Skewness of neuropil-corrected fluorescence traces
- `std`: Standard deviation of neuropil-corrected fluorescence traces

__`rois`:__
- `data`: Values of the weighted rois
- `coords`: Index locations of every `data` value
- `shape`: Shape of the ROI array, # neurons x height of FOV (in pixels) x width of FOV (in pixels)
- `aspect_ratio`, `compact`, `footprint`, `med`, `mrs`, `mrs0`, `npix`, `npix_norm`, `npix_norm_no_crop`, `npix_soma`, `overlap`, `radius`, `solidity`, `soma_crop`: Additional ROI stats, see suite2p documentation

__`cellpose`:__
- `masks`: Labeled image, where 0=no masks; 1,2,â€¦=mask labels.
- `flows_in_hsv`: XY flow in HSV 0-255
- `flows`: XY flows at each pixel
- `cellprob`: Cell probability at each pixel
- `final_locations`: Final pixel locations after Euler integration
- `styles`: Style vector summarizing each image

Additional datasets at the root of `extraction.h5` are:
- `iscell`: Specifies whether an ROI is a cell, first column is 0/1, and second column is probability that the ROI is a cell based on the default classifier
- `neuropil_coords`: Index locations of neuropil masks
- `neuropil_rcoef`: Coefficients used for neuropil correction
- `raw_neuropil_rcoef_mutualinfo`: Raw coefficients for neuropil correction (minimizing mutual information between corrected and neuropil trace)
